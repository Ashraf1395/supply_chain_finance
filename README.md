# supply_chain_finance

# Project Overview

The project aims to address challenges faced by traditional supply chain finance methods by developing a real-time supply chain finance analysis platform. This platform integrates data streams from various sources, processes them in real-time, stores historical data for deeper analysis, and provides visualization and analysis tools for proactive decision-making.

## Problem Statement

**Challenge:** Traditional supply chain finance methods suffer from inefficiencies such as delayed payments, inventory mismanagement, fraudulent activities, and limited cash flow management due to reliance on static data.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. **Integrating Data Streams:** Real-time data on logistics, supplier activities, and customer interactions will be collected using Kafka.
2. **Real-time Data Processing:** Spark Streaming or Kafa will be utilized to analyze incoming data streams, identifying trends and anomalies in real-time.
3. **Historical Data Storage:** Historical data will be stored in BigQuery for deeper analysis and trend identification.
4. **Visualization and Analysis:** Looker will be used to create interactive dashboards visualizing key metrics like inventory levels, payment delays, and financial commitments.
5. **Proactive Decision-making:** Real-time insights will enable proactive decision-making regarding early payments, inventory management, and fraud detection.

# Project Architecture Overview

![Architecture](./images/architecture_image.png)

The project architecture revolves around seamless data flow, orchestrated by Docker containers and various data processing pipelines. Events originating from offline retail stores and CSV files are captured in a streaming Docker container, forwarded to a Kafka topic named "supply_chain_data," and processed through a series of pipelines for transformation and analysis.

## Data Flow

- **Data Ingestion**: Events from offline retail stores and CSV files are produced in a streaming Docker container and sent to the Kafka topic "supply_chain_data."
  
- **Batch Processing**: Kafka Streaming pipeline, orchestrated by Mage, consumes data in batches of 1000. The data is then sent to a GCS bucket as "raw_streaming" and stored in a PostgreSQL database as bronze-level data.

- **Transformation**: Raw streaming data from the GCS bucket undergoes transformation by Apache Spark, resulting in OLAP database design star schema format, and stored back into the GCS bucket as "transformed" silver-level data.

- **Export to BigQuery**: A Mage pipeline exports transformed data from the GCS bucket to BigQuery, facilitating easy accessibility and analysis.

- **DBT Transformation**: Transformed data in BigQuery is further transformed into "business transformed" gold-level data using DBT, ensuring enhanced analytics capabilities and insights extraction.

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as a Service provided by Terraform. Used to create gcp resources like Google cloud buckets,bigquery datasets and compute service to run mage and the project.

## Other Features

- **Data Quality Assurance**: The architecture incorporates three different data levels—bronze, silver, and gold—ensuring high-quality data availability for analysts and data scientists, catering to diverse use cases.

- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Dockerized containers offer flexibility and scalability, enabling seamless integration and deployment of various components, ensuring adaptability to changing business needs.

- **Comprehensive Analytics**: The gold-level data stored in BigQuery serves as a robust foundation for downstream use cases, including dashboarding using Metabase, reporting, and machine learning for fraud detection, facilitating comprehensive analytics and informed decision-making.

## Additional Benefits

- **Modularity and Maintainability**: The modular design of the architecture promotes maintainability, allowing for easy updates and modifications to individual components without disrupting the entire system.

- **Cost-Efficiency**: By leveraging cloud-native services like GCS and BigQuery, the project optimizes costs associated with data storage and processing, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

- **Scalability and Performance**: The distributed nature of Apache Spark and Kafka Streaming enables scalability and performance enhancements, ensuring timely processing of large volumes of data without compromising performance.

Overall, the project architecture embodies best practices in data engineering, ensuring seamless data flow, high-quality data availability, and comprehensive analytics capabilities to drive business success.

## Step-by-Step Execution Guide

I have created commands to run different parts of the project which makes running this project
very easy. For any queries or debugging help check the Debug [Readme](./debug.md).

Link the Tutorial Video: https://www.loom.com/share/c358150b5f864deb80e47900451b6d9c?sid=52014c06-6834-4f2a-a716-9dbf59b634c1

Follow these steps to execute the project seamlessly but before that whenever you start a new terminal
run this command `source commands.sh` to create all the functions and environment variables.:

### 0. Initialising Terraform and creating Resources

Before this create a service account in GCP and get the credentials.json key.
Copy it in Docker/mage/ directory in place of google-cred.json
`Keeping the name google-cred.json is necessary`.

```bash
    terraform-start
```
This initialises terraform,gives you the overall plan and creates the resources.
if you want to destroy the reosurces use this command `terraform-destory`.

### 1. Start Streaming Pipeline

```bash
start-streaming-pipeline
```
This command initiates the streaming pipeline, which involves the following sub-steps:

- **Start Kafka**: Launches Kafka within a Docker container using the command `start-kafka`.
- **Start Mage**: Initiates Mage pipeline execution using the command `start-mage`.
- **Produce Stream Data**: Starts producing stream data by executing `start-stream`.

### 2. Start Batch Pipeline

```bash
start-batch-pipeline
```
This command kicks off the batch pipeline, consisting of the following sub-steps:

- **OLAP Transformation Pipeline**: Initiates Apache Spark and executes the OLAP transformation pipeline using the command `olap-transformation-pipeline`.
- **GCS-to-BigQuery Pipeline**: Triggers the Mage pipeline to export data to BigQuery using the command `gcs-to-bigquery-pipeline`.

### 3. DBT Transformation

Run the command `dbt run` to create the gold level transformations.

### 4. Dashboard Creation

Start Metabase using the following command:

```bash
start-metabase
```
With Metabase running, create insightful dashboards and reports using the transformed data stored in BigQuery.

![Dasboard Example](./images/supply_chain_finance-1.png)

### Automating all steps:

Use this command

```
start-project
```

This will run the entire project on its own.
Things you need to take care:
 - Updating the api endpoint for gcs-to-bigquery-pipeline(Shown in the tutorial video)
 - Executing the kafka_to_gcs pipeline from mage ui(Show in the project)

## Deliverables

The project will deliver:
- Integration of data streams using Kafka.
- Real-time data processing and analysis using Spark,Mage and Kafka Streaming.
- Historical data storage and analysis capabilities in BigQuery.
- Interactive dashboards created with Looker for visualization and analysis.
- Proactive decision-making capabilities enabled by real-time insights.
